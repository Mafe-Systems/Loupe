## Installation

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

3. **Create a `config.json` file:**

     "prefix": "!",
     "adminID": "YOUR_ADMIN_USER_ID",

## Usage

Once the bot is running, you can use the following commands in your Discord server:

- **`!kick <user>`**: Kicks a mentioned user from the server (admin only).
